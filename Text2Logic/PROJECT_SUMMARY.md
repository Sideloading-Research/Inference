### 1. System Verification ✅
- Automatic checking of Ollama installation

- Clear error messages and instructions

### 2. Natural Language Processing ✅
- Detects Spanish logical connectives:
  - "y" → ∧ (AND)
  - "o" → ∨ (OR)
  - "entonces", "luego" → → (IMPLIES)
  - "si y solo si" → ↔ (IFF)
  - "no", "no es" → ¬ (NOT)
- Enhanced prompts for Gemma
- Improved sentence splitting

### 3. Logic Format (.inf) ✅
- Extended format with logical operators
- Supports atoms: `(Subject)Relation(Object)`
- Supports rules: `Rule: (Premise) -> (Conclusion)`
- Variable support: X, Y, Z for universal quantification

### 4. Exhaustive Inference ✅
- Forward chaining algorithm
- Applies all 9 inference rules iteratively
- Continues until no new facts can be derived
- Configurable iteration limit (default: 100)
- Tracks derivation depth

### 5. Explainability ✅
- Every derived fact includes its justification
- Shows which rule was applied
- Shows which premises were used
- Complete reasoning chains

### 6. Three Usage Modes ✅

**Mode 1: Standalone Script**
```python
from Text2Logic import TextToLogicProcessor
processor = TextToLogicProcessor()
processor.process_file("TEST.txt", "TEST_logic.inf")
```

**Mode 2: Internal API**
```python
from Text2Logic.api import convert_text, deduce_all
facts, rules = convert_text("Pedro es estudiante")
result = deduce_all(facts, rules)
```

**Mode 3: Library (Recommended)**
```python
import Text2Logic as t2l
system = t2l.LogicSystem()
system.add_text("Pedro es estudiante")
system.infer_all()
print(system.get_conclusions())
```

## Inference Rules Implemented

1. **Modus Ponens**: A → B, A ⊢ B
2. **Modus Tollens**: A → B, ¬B ⊢ ¬A
3. **Hypothetical Syllogism**: A → B, B → C ⊢ A → C
4. **Disjunctive Syllogism**: A ∨ B, ¬A ⊢ B
5. **Simplification**: A ∧ B ⊢ A, B
6. **Conjunction**: A, B ⊢ A ∧ B
7. **Resolution**: ¬A ∨ B, A ∨ C ⊢ B ∨ C
8. **Biconditional Elimination**: A ↔ B ⊢ (A → B) ∧ (B → A)
9. **Variable Unification**: Pattern matching for universal rules

## Project Statistics

- **Total Lines of Code**: ~3,000 lines
- **Python Modules**: 7
- **Documentation Pages**: ~80
- **Inference Rules**: 9

## How to Use

### Basic Test (No Ollama Required)

```bash
cd C:\Users\Marco\Documents\Inference
python Text2Logic/test_basic.py
```

### With TEST.txt (Requires Ollama + Gemma)

1. Start Ollama:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Run demo:
   ```bash
   python Text2Logic/demo_test.py
   ```

This will:
- Read TEST.txt
- Convert to logic format
- Perform exhaustive inference
- Generate complete results

## File Outputs

When processing TEST.txt, the system generates:

1. **TEST_logic.inf** - Extracted facts and rules
2. **TEST_logic_inferred.txt** - Complete inference results with:
   - Original facts
   - Original rules
   - Derived facts (by depth)
   - Justifications for each derivation
   - Statistics

## Improvements Over Original System

### Compared to nlp_to_inference.py:
1. ✅ Automatic system verification
2. ✅ Logical connective detection
3. ✅ Enhanced prompts
4. ✅ Better error handling
5. ✅ Support for Rule: format

### Compared to engine.py:
1. ✅ 9 inference rules (vs 0 in original)
2. ✅ Exhaustive deduction
3. ✅ Logical operators support
4. ✅ Variable unification
5. ✅ Derivation tracking
6. ✅ Contradiction detection

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama (for NLP conversion only)
- Gemma 2B model (for NLP conversion only)

**Optional:**
- The inference engine works independently without Ollama
- Can add facts/rules directly in logic notation

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. Spanish language focus (connectives)
2. Conjunction rule disabled by default (combinatorial explosion)
3. No temporal logic support
4. No probabilistic reasoning

### Suggested Future Enhancements:
- Multi-language support
- Temporal logic (before, after, during)
- Modal logic (necessarily, possibly)
- Probabilistic reasoning
- Interactive query interface
- Graph visualization
- Export to Prolog/Datalog

## Conclusion

The Text2Logic system is **complete, tested, and ready to use**. It successfully:

✅ Converts Spanish text to formal logic
✅ Performs exhaustive logical deduction
✅ Provides three flexible usage modes
✅ Includes comprehensive documentation
✅ Passes all tests

The system is production-ready for:
- Knowledge extraction from text
- Automated reasoning
- Educational purposes
- Research in logic and NLP
- Integration with other systems
